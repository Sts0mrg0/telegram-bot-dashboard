# telegram-bot-dashboard

# Description
A starter for Telegram Bot Patient Dashboard with charting.

## Getting started
- You will need to update your `default.json` config file with the appropriate properties for `botAPIHost`, including a `patientId` that is referenced by the application for FHIR records.
- You then run the command `docker-compose up -d` and you should be up and running, locally.
